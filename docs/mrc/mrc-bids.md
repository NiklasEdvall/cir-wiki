title: BIDS at MRC
---

The Brain Imaging Data Structure [BIDS](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a community driven standard for organizing imaging data that simplify data sharing and collaboration. Organizing your data according to BIDS promote data sharing and enable the use of common pre-processing pipelines and tools (e.g. [fmriprep](https://fmriprep.org/en/stable/) and [MRIQC](https://mriqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)), promoting traceable and reproducible research.

## Your data at CIR
If you don't have a project or are starting up data collection at MRC, consult the [road map for projects at CIR](https://ki.se/en/research/research-areas-centres-and-networks/research-centres/centre-for-imaging-research-cir/road-map-for-projects-at-cir) for logical next steps for you to consider. The [data collection page](https://k-cir.github.io/cir-wiki/01_data_collection/) provide context for how and why CIR gather data for your project and how to register your data collection.

## MRC raw data
Research data collected at MRC should be pushed to the server **FOU1** after each completed session. Doing so, and registering your session in the [CIR-session Redcap form](https://redcap.link/cir-session) ensure your data is collected in your project folder on [SPICE](https://k-cir.github.io/cir-wiki/SPICE/) within 24 hours. The data is stored in the original DICOM format and organized according to a study specific subject ID, session number and MRI sequence number.

The raw data in your project on SPICE will be structured like this:
```markdown
/data/projects/yourproject/raw/mri/sub-XXX/ses-XX/
├── 00000001
|       ├ 0000001.dcm
|       ├ 0000002.dcm
|       ├ ....
|       └─0000180.dcm
├── 00000002
|       ├ 0000001.dcm
|       ├ 0000002.dcm
|       ├ ....
|       └─0001985.dcm
└── 00000003
        ├ 0000001.dcm
        ├ 0000002.dcm
        ├ ....
        └─0022500.dcm
```
<br>

CIR offer support in organizing your data as BIDS and provide an simplified interface for using the [dcm2bids](https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/3.2.0/) in [parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/) to effeciently organizing your data on SPICE. Essentially, dcm2bids look through your raw data, check if the DICOM metadata match the criteria you specify in a config file and if so, convert those DICOM files to Nifti and organize them in a BIDS format. 

The dcm2bids config file is a JSON file that specify what criteria to look for in the DICOM metadata for each sequence in your protocol and how to name the output files. Building this config file can be a bit tricky, but CIR offer this helper that extract the relevant DICOM metadata from your data and present it in an interactive table in your browser so you can select what criteria to include in your config file.

This is done with two repositories, publicly available on Github:

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0; line-height: 1.2;">
  <a href="https://github.com/k-CIR/bids-utils-mr" target="_blank">1. bids-utils-mr</a>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Clone the repository to your project folder on SPICE (using git). It will manage all the processing on SPICE and setup a server for you to inspect your data, create a config file and run processing via the browser on your local computer. The repository contain:</p>

- **index.html** - A html file with an interface for running dcm2bids
- **server.py** - A python script that set up an http server that function as a bridge between SPICE, were the process is happening, and your local computer.
- **config_builder.py** - A python script that help you build the config file needed for dcm2bids.
- **bids_runner.py** - A script running dcm2bids in parallel on SPICE.

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 36px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0; line-height: 1.2;">
  <a href="https://github.com/k-CIR/serve-mr-bids" target="_blank">2. serve-mr-bids</a>
</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Clone this repository to your local machine. It contains a simple script that prompt for your user details for connecting to SPICE and project name.</p>

- **ssh-connect.sh** - A shell script for connecting to SPICE via SSH prompting you for username, project and password (if you don't have SSH keys setup). The script will also setup port forwarding for you to be able to access the server running on SPICE from your local computer. On connection it prints a unique URL to terminal that you can open in your local browser to access the interface for running dcm2bids on SPICE.

**Note:** As always you need to be on the KI network or connected to KI via VPN to access SPICE. You also need to have a user account on SPICE and access to the project you want to work with.

# Step by step guide

## 0. Know your data
Before you start, make sure you have an understanding of the data collected for your project. What sequences do you have in your protocol and how are they organized? What are the tasks and patient instructions included in the protocol? Do you need to recode your data, e.g. if you have other data that you want BIDS subject and session IDs to match?

This approach assume your data is organized as it is delivered from CIR, i.e. on SPICE in `/data/projects/yourproject/raw/mri` - if you have renamed it, moved it, converted or transformed it already - you will run in to problems.

## 1. Get repositories
Clone the two repositories mentioned above, [bids-utils-mr](https://github.com/k-CIR/bids-utils-mr) to your project folder on SPICE and [serve-mr-bids](https://github.com/k-CIR/serve-mr-bids) to your local computer. If you are new to git and github, plenty of guides are available [online](https://google.com/search?q=git+github+tutorial+how to clone a repository). And there is a brief description on how to set up git with an SSH key for authentication in the [SPICE wiki pag: version control with git](https://k-cir.github.io/cir-wiki/SPICE/02_best_practice/#version-control-with-git).

## 2. Connect to SPICE and start the server
Run the `ssh-connect.sh` script from the `serve-mr-bids` repository on your local computer: `bash ssh-connect.sh`. On Windows, it is easiest to use [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/install/windows)). This will prompt you for your SPICE username, project name and password (if you don't have SSH keys setup). After connection, the script will set up port forwarding for you to be able to access the server running on SPICE from your local computer. On connection, it prints a URL, unique to this session, to terminal that you can open (ctrl+click link in Git Bash) in your local browser to access the interface for running dcm2bids on SPICE.

**Note:** the project name must be specified as its path/folder name in `/data/projects`.

## 3. Analyze your data
Open the URL in your local browser. If this is your first time, you will see the window below. You are prompted to select one representative session from your data. This session will be analyzed with the [dcm2bids_helper](https://unfmontreal.github.io/Dcm2Bids/3.2.0/tutorial/first-steps/#dcm2bids_helper-command) function.

This function go through the DICOM files in the selected session and export their unique DICOM meta data to a JSON file for each unique sequence. These are saved in the `bids-utils-mr` folder on SPICE under `dcm2bids_helper/helper`.

Note that localizer/scout sequences and calibrations sequences genereated by the camera are excluded. Susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) sequences are not yet defined in BIDS and are not included in the helper output. See BIDS Extension Proposal [BEP-004](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/v1.2.1/06-extensions.html) for progress on defining SWI in BIDS.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids1.png){ width="750" }

Clicking **Analyze DICOM fields** will start the analysis. Depending on how many and what sequences are in the selected session, this will take a couple of minutes to complete. The ouput from `dcm2bids_helper` is printed in the faux terminal window on the page. When the analysis is done, a summary of the most commonly used fields are printed in a table in the browser so that you can use these to build your config file for dcm2bids. These are:

- `Series number`: The order the sequence was run in your protocol.
- `Series description`: The name of the sequence in your protocol.
- `Pulse sequence name`: The name of the sequence as it is saved in the DICOM metadata.
- `Image type`: A list of keywords describing the sequence, e.g. `ORIGINAL`, `PRIMARY`, `PERFUSION`

You *can* select and analyze different sessions for defining your config file, but easiest for you is to select a session that you know contain all the sequences you are interested in. Check the box `Force dcm2bids_helper` to overwrite the current JSON helper files with new ones.

## 4. Build config file

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0; line-height: 1.2;">The input</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">When <code>dcm2bids_helper</code> is done, the section <b>2. Specify config</b> shows up. This section summarize the DICOM fields from the JSON files created by <code>dcm2bids_helper</code> (i.e. your representative session). Now, you can use what is in your data to construct a config file for <code>dcm2bids</code> so it knows what inputs to look for in your raw data and what outputs to genarate as BIDS. This is an important step that can require some detective work, esepecially if you skipped step 0 above, but you only need to do this once.</p>

If you ran the helper before, this table will show the summary from the last session you analyzed. In the image below is an example of a session that has one structural T1 sequence and an Arterial Spin Labeling (ASL) sequence.

The left columns under **INPUT** are used to define the inputs for `dcm2bids`. That is, what do you want `dcm2bids` to look for in your data. Click on the fields in the table to select them to be included as a criteria for that sequence in the config file. You must select at least one field as a criteria in each sequence you want included.

If you want `dcm2bids` to skip a sequence, simply do not select any criteria for that sequence and it will be ignored, and not included in the BIDS output.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids2.png){ width="750" }
/// caption
///

Note that the ASL sequence (Series number 5) is split in two entries. Some sequences are split and need to be BIDSified separately. In the case of this ASL sequence, we see in the column `Image type` that the first entry is the `ORIGINAL` m0 reference scan and the second entry the `DERIVED` perfusion-weighted ASL image.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids3.png){ width="750" }
/// caption
///

For the T1 it's enough to select its unique `Series description` as a criteria for identifying this as a unique sequence in the data. For the ASL sequence, the `Image type` must also be selected and included as a criteria to keep the ASL data and the m0 reference scan separate in the BIDS output. That is, the combination of criteria must be unique for each row of data that you want in the BIDS output. If not, dcm2bids will not know how to separate them and they will be merged in the BIDS output, or separated by the best guess dcm2bids can make, usually by includig a `run-1` and `run-2` tag.


<br>
<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0; line-height: 1.2;">The output</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">For the output section you MUST specify the <b>datatype </b>and <b>suffix</b> as indicated by an angry asterisk. For MR, datatype is either <code>anat</code>, <code>func</code>, <code>perf</code>, <code>dwi</code> or <code>fmap</code>. See the <a href="https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common-principles.html#definitions" target="_blank">BIDS documentation</a> for details on these. The suffix is more flexible but MUST match the datatype, generally the suffix specify the type of sequence used to collect the data, e.g. <code>T1w</code> or <code>FLAIR</code> for anatomical/structural data, <code>bold</code> for functional MRI data, and so on. The most common suffixes are available in a drop-down menu, but you can instead specify a specific suffix in free text under <code>Other suffix</code>.</p>

In the image below, you can see we have specified datatype `anat` and suffix `T1w` for the T1 sequence, and datatype `perf` with suffix `asl` for the ASL sequence and `m0scan` for the m0 reference scan. This will result in the T1 sequence being saved as `sub-XXX_ses-XX_T1w.nii.gz` and the ASL sequence as `sub-XXX_ses-XX_asl.nii.gz` and `sub-XXX_ses-XX_m0scan.nii.gz` in the BIDS output.

The other output fields are optional but can be used to further specify unique output file names. For example, many fMRI protocols include a task that should then be specified. Consult the [BIDS documentation](https://bids-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/appendices/entities.html) for the use of different entities, in short:

- Task name `task`: The name of the task performed during the scan, e.g. `rest` for resting state fMRI or `nback` for an n-back working memory task.
- Acquisition `acq`: The name of the acquisition protocol or equipment used. Useful for example if study is using more than one scanner model.
- Run `run`: The run number of the sequence. Useful if you have more than one run of the same sequence in your protocol, e.g. two runs of resting state fMRI.
- Description `desc`: Used to distinguish two files that do not otherwise have a distinguishing entity.

When you have specified a unique input as criteria, and a unique output for the resulting BIDS, for each sequence you want to include you click **Generate config file** to write your specifications to `dcm2bids_config.json` in the `bids-utils-mr` folder on SPICE. This is the config file that will be used as input for `dcm2bids` to organize your data as BIDS. This file will be loaded automatically next time you open this page, but you can also load it manually by clicking **Load config file**.

If you do not have a complete, representative session with all the sequences you want to include in your BIDS output, you can still use **Append to config** to append a new sequence input criteria and output structure to the config file while keeping the existing specifications.

You can also edit the config file manually if you want, in the tab **Config Editor** - but be careful to keep the JSON format.

<p style="text-align: left; font-size: 22px; font-weight: bold; margin: 0 !important; padding: 0; line-height: 1.2;">A complete example</p>
<p style="margin-top: 0;">The image below show a complete example from a study including 13 different sequences, most included in the standard, recommended <a href="https://k-cir.github.io/cir-wiki/mrc/mrc-cir-protocol/"; target="_blank">CIR protocol</a>.</p> Columns not used here are cropped out of the image to make it easier to read.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids5.png){ width="1100" }
/// caption
An example of a complete, and pretty busy, protocol. Scroll to the bottom of this page to see the output from running this config file.
///

Note that functional sequences, i.e. with data type `func` specify a task name to distinguish them from each other.

This protocol include 4 `fmap` sequences, intended to be used as reference either for `fmri` or `dwi` sequences. The `desc` column is used to distinguish two epi fieldmaps. Subsequently, these files will be named `sub-012_ses-01_desc-dwi_epi.nii.gz` and `sub-012_ses-01_desc-fmri_epi.nii.gz` in the BIDS output. Without the `desc` field these would both collide on the file name `sub-012_ses-01_epi.nii.gz` in this case.

## 5. Inspect your config file
You can view and make manual edits to your config file in the tab **Config Editor**. Be careful to keep the JSON format if you make manual edits here. It may be a good idea to keep a backup of your config file, both for book keeping and especially before making manual edits.

## 6. Check subjects and sessions
On the final tab **Make BIDS** you first check that paths you are using in your project folder are correct and then click **Discover sessions** to list all the sessions available for you to BIDSify.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids7.png){ width="650" }
/// caption
///

A table will show all subjects and sessions available in your raw data folder. You can specify which subjects and sessions to include in the BIDS output by checking the boxes in the table. Generally CIR will deliver your data in a pseduo-BIDS format but you can rename a subject and session if your raw data is not matching what you need for your BIDS output. Your recode-key will be saved as `session_recode.csv` in the `bids-utils-mr` folder on SPICE for you to keep track of how you have renamed your data.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids8.png){ width="950" }
/// caption
///

In the image above we see two sessions discovered, one subject is saved as an ID and date-time `12345_20231224_133705`, a legacy format for MRI data at MRC. The participant ID is correctly extracted, but doesn't match our other subject and there is no session number.

We simply type in a new subject ID and session number in the table to recode this session to match the BIDS output we want. In this case, we recode the subject to `sub-012` and session to `ses-01`. This is saved in the recode key so that next time we open this page, the same session is recoded to the same subject and session ID. Three digit subject IDs and two digit session numbers, both with leading zero-padding, are recommended.

![Edit this page screenshot]({{ picture_path }}/mr-bids9.png){ width="950" }
/// caption
///

## 7. Run dcm2bids
Finally, you click **Run dcm2bids** to start the processing. This will run `dcm2bids` in parallel on SPICE for all the sessions you have selected. You can select the number of parallell processes, up to 24, in the box for `Max parallel workers`.

Depending on how many sessions you have selected and how many sequences are in your protocol, this can take a while to complete. The output from `dcm2bids` is printed in the faux terminal window on the page so you can follow the progress and check for any errors.

This process is designed to be able to run regularly during your project. No need to wait until you have collected all your data to start organizing it as BIDS. Rather, start early to identify and correct any issues with your config file or mismatch naming in your protocol or raw data.

Your config file and recode key are saved in the `bids-utils-mr` folder in your project folder on SPICE and dcm2bids do not overwrite already existing BIDS files unless you tell it to (by checking `--clobber`).
